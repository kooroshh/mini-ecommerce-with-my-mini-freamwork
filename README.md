# Mini PHP Framework

This is a mini framework written in PHP, designed solely for practice and learning web development. It is not suitable for production use. Using this framework, I have built a mini eCommerce platform as a demonstration.

## Features

- Simple MVC architecture implementation
- Basic routing system
- Uses PDO for database interactions
- Basic cart and order management
- Ability to add and display products
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
